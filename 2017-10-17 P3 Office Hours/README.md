## Shell

zsh is great. It's not the only great shell, but it's justin's favorite great shell.

`oh-my-zsh` is a great framework to configure your zsh shell and includes tons of plugins.

## Keyboard shortcuts

There are some default key bindings in MacOS that are really useful, which are based on the emacs editor. See: https://jblevins.org/log/kbd  

A few examples:
`ctrl-f` Move forward one character
`ctrl-b` Move backward one character
`ctrl-d` Delete forward
etc...

Some other useful keyboard shortcuts in atom:

`ctrl-alt-r` Select & simultaneously edit all variables in the current scope (Requires packages: `refactor`, `js-refactor`)

`cmd-ctrl-g` Select & simultaneously edit all variables in whole document

`cmd-d` Select & simultaneously edit the next variable in multi-selection

`cmd-shift-d` duplicate lines

`cmd-.` to view key function

`cmd-shift-click` to create multiple cursors

`alt+up` or `alt+down` to select up and down (Requires packages: `multi-cursor`)
